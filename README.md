# Component 2 - Task

<p>The current git repository is an empty Laravel project. It contains the base package.json file that will allow all required files to be downloaded locally with the command <b>composer update</b>. For this component you should add authentication packages as your first step. See the Laravel site for how to add Laravel Breeze<p>

<p>This task is based around the first case study and a Product catalogue (CDs/DVD/Games). You are expected to build a larger web application to showcase your understanding of Laravel and working with Models, Views and Controllers. You will be able to distinguish different user roles - i.e. only an admin will be able to add/edit/delete products. It is expected that you will use Factories to populate the database with a large dataset (>100 products) and that filtering will be applied to help a customer locate products.

</p>
<ul>
